# Methodology
Two teams of elite Gecko Security Researchers test your Smart Contracts, performing independent reviews.

<img src="https://github.com/Gecko-Security/audits/assets/22000925/aab80640-a28a-4ee3-9735-190fa4121efc" alt="Gecko_Methodology" style="width: 50%;" />

# Pay-Per-Vulnerability
Gecko offers two engagement pricing options: Flat-cost and Pay-per-vulnerability

Think your code is unbreakable?
- Go with the Pay-per-vulnerability option
Just want to fit us into your budget?
- Take the Flat-cost


# Fuzzing
Smart Contract Fuzzing simulates millions of randomized and targeted transactions probing your system for critical flaws.
In every engagement, Gecko fuzzing engineers construct a comprehensive stateful fuzzing suite for your Smart Contract system.

# Remediation Review
All remediations are reviewed by both teams independently and fuzzed thoroughly to ensure issues are fully patched and no new issues arise.
