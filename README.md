# Fuzzing
Smart Contract Fuzzing simulates millions of randomized and targeted transactions probing your system for critical flaws.
In every engagement, Gecko fuzzing engineers construct a comprehensive stateful fuzzing suite for your Smart Contract system.

# Remediation Review
All remediations are reviewed by both teams independently and fuzzed thoroughly to ensure issues are fully patched and no new issues arise.
