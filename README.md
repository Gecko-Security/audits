# Pay-Per-Vulnerability
Gecko offers two engagement pricing options: Flat-cost and Pay-per-vulnerability

Think your code is unbreakable?
→ Go with the Pay-per-vulnerability option

Just want to fit us into your budget?
→ Take the Flat-cost

# Fuzzing
Smart Contract Fuzzing simulates millions of randomized and targeted transactions probing your system for critical flaws. 

In every engagement, Guardian fuzzing engineers construct a comprehensive stateful fuzzing suite for your Smart Contract system.

# Remediation Review
All remediations are reviewed by both teams independently and fuzzed thoroughly to ensure issues are fully patched and no new issues arise.
